# FAST-PT

FASTPT is code to calculate 1-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in cosmology. 
The code utilizes Fouier Methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the computation time down 
to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid point in the input linear power spectrum.
