# FAST-PT

FASTPT is code to calculate 1-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in cosmology. 
The code utilizes Fouier Methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the computation time down 
to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid point in the input linear power spectrum. 

FAST-PT way to get started: 

* Make sure you have current numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
* download
* in terminal type the following 
* python FASTPT.py
* (hopefully you get a plot)
